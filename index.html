    <h1><b><u>SDG 15</u></b></h1>
    <h2><u>Goals</u></h2>
    <p>
        Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15), known as "Life on Land," encompasses a series of specific targets designed to protect, restore, and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. Here are the key goals of SDG 15:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Conserve and Restore Terrestrial and Inland Freshwater Ecosystems:</b> Ensure the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, particularly forests, wetlands, mountains, and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.</li>
        <li><b>Sustainable Management of Forests: </b>Promote the sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests, and significantly increase afforestation and reforestation globally.</li>
        <li><b>Sustainable Management of Forests: </b>Combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought, and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world.</li>
        <li><b>Halt Biodiversity Loss: </b>Ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, to enhance their capacity to provide benefits essential for sustainable development.</li>
        <li><b>Protect Natural Habitats: </b>Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity, and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species.</li>
        <li><b>Fair Sharing of Genetic Resources: </b>Promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and promote appropriate access to such resources, as internationally agreed.</li>
        <li><b>Combat Poaching and Trafficking: </b>Take urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna and address both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products.</li>
        <li><b>Prevent Invasive Alien Species: </b>Introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems, and control or eradicate priority species.</li>
        <li><b>Integrate Ecosystem and Biodiversity Values: </b>Integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies, and accounts.</li>
        <li><b>Mobilize Financial Resources: </b>Mobilize and significantly increase financial resources from all sources to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems.</li>
        <li><b>Combat Global Poaching and Trafficking Networks: </b>Enhance global support to combat poaching and trafficking of protected species, including by increasing the capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable livelihood opportunities.</li>
        <li><b>Strengthen Capacity: </b>Build capacity to manage forests and other natural resources sustainably, involving local and indigenous communities in decision-making processes, and ensuring their rights and knowledge are respected.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        These targets collectively aim to safeguard the planet's terrestrial ecosystems, ensure their sustainable use, and halt biodiversity loss, which is crucial for maintaining the Earth's health and supporting human well-being.
    </p>

    <h2><u>Relevance</u></h2>
    <p>
        Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15), titled "Life on Land," is increasingly relevant in today's world as it addresses critical issues related to the health and sustainability of our planet's terrestrial ecosystems. The urgency of SDG 15 is underscored by several pressing environmental challenges that have profound implications for biodiversity, climate stability, and human well-being.
    </p>
    <h3>Biodiversity Loss</h3>
    <p>
        Biodiversity is in decline at an unprecedented rate, with species extinction rates accelerating due to habitat destruction, climate change, pollution, and overexploitation. The loss of biodiversity threatens ecosystem services that are vital for human survival, including food security, clean water, and disease regulation. SDG 15 aims to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by promoting the conservation of ecosystems and protecting endangered species.
    </p>
    <h3>Climate Change</h3>
    <p>
        Forests and other terrestrial ecosystems play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate by sequestering carbon dioxide. Deforestation and land degradation release significant amounts of greenhouse gases, exacerbating global warming. By promoting sustainable forest management and land restoration, SDG 15 contributes to climate change mitigation and helps build resilience against climate impacts.
    </p>
    <h3>Sustainable Land Use</h3>
    <p>
        Land degradation, driven by unsustainable agricultural practices, urbanization, and industrial activities, affects over a quarter of the world's land area. This degradation reduces the land's productivity, undermining food security and livelihoods, particularly for vulnerable communities. SDG 15 advocates for the sustainable use of land resources, combatting desertification, and striving for a land degradation-neutral world.
    </p>
    <h3>Human Health and Well-being</h3>
    <p>
        Healthy terrestrial ecosystems are essential for human health and well-being. They provide clean air, water, and fertile soil, and support a diverse array of plant and animal life that contributes to medical discoveries and natural remedies. By ensuring the protection and sustainable management of these ecosystems, SDG 15 supports overall human health and quality of life.
    </p>
    <h3>Socioeconomic Benefits</h3>
    <p>
        Many communities, particularly indigenous peoples, rely directly on forests and other ecosystems for their livelihoods, cultural practices, and identities. Protecting and restoring these ecosystems not only preserves biodiversity but also supports economic development, poverty reduction, and the preservation of cultural heritage.
    </p>
    <h3>Global Cooperation and Policy Integration</h3>
    <p>
        Achieving SDG 15 requires global cooperation and the integration of ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning. This goal encourages countries to adopt policies and practices that promote sustainable development and ensure that the benefits of biodiversity and ecosystem services are equitably shared.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        In today's context, SDG 15 is more relevant than ever. It addresses the interconnectedness of environmental health, economic stability, and human well-being. By focusing on the protection, restoration, and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, SDG 15 provides a comprehensive framework for tackling some of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. Its successful implementation is crucial for ensuring a sustainable and resilient future for all.

    <h2>Our Expert Interview</h2>
    <p>
        We asked many organizations like WWF, Re:wild, Fridays For Future, and Kassel's city council to answer our questions regarding SDG 15.<br>
        We fortunately got an answer from the head of the environmental agency and garden department of Kassel's city council!<br>
        In the following are our questions as well as the city council's answers.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>What are the key challenges facing the promotion of life on land, particularly in the context of your work or organization?</b><br>
            "For Kassel municipality we focus on 4 key aspects:
            <ul>
                <li>climate protection</li>

                <li>adaption to the consequences of climate change</li>

                <li>biodiversity</li>

                <li>environmental justice"</li>
            </ul>
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Could you share some successful initiatives or projects your organization has undertaken to address these challenges?</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li>"installation of a climate protection advisory board</li>

                <li>plan for decarbonisation of heat supply</li>

                <li>models on overheating and heavy rainfall</li>

                <li>funding programmes for roof and facade greening</li>

                <li>concept on de-paving</li>

                <li>planting more trees and new tree species</li>

                <li>wildflower strips</li>

                <li>extensification of lawn mowing</li>

                <li>concept on environmental justice"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>How can individuals, communities, and governments contribute to the conservation and sustainable management of terrestrial ecosystems?</b><br>
            <p>"a lot - cannot be answered briefly"</p>
            <p>Since this answer is not very detailed, we would like to answer that question!<br>
            We ourselves think that individuals can reduce their consumption such as stop using non-renewable energy sources or stop burning wood to keep oneself warm.<br>
            Regarding Communities, they can try and educate their community about the SDG 15 and try to find things to do together like plant trees.<br>
            Lastly what governments could do is enforce policies like prohibiting mass deforestation or forcing chopped down trees to be replanted.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>In your opinion, what role can technology and innovation play in advancing SDG 15 targets?</b><br>

            "innovative thinking: a lot<br>
            technology: a bit<br>
            It is acknowledged, that technology alone will not solve the problems that we produce due to our living standard and consumption habits in quantity and quality."

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>In your opinion, what are the most pressing challenges facing terrestrial ecosystems today?</b><br>

            <ul>
                <li>"climate change</li>
                <li>loss of biodiversity</li>
                <li>land consumption"</li>
            </ul>

        </li>

        <li>
            <b>What advice would you give to young people who are passionate about environmental sustainability and want to make a difference in promoting life on land?</b><br>
            <p>"Have the courage to use your own mind.</p>
            <p>You cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.</p>
            <p>Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.</p>
            <p>And a personal one: Choose a life and a profession that indeed allows creating a difference. It would certainly not be a life or profession that is said to be the one."</p>
        </li>

    <h2>What does our school do regarding Life on Land?</h2>
    <p>
        The Wilhelmsgymnasium Kassel has had its own environmental committee since 2019, in which they try to make everyday tasks as environmentally friendly as possible. This involves: mobility (explaining how good bicycles are), campaigns and projects (waste separation, upcycling competition, clothing swap campaign), awareness of more sustainability for younger classes and public relations (getting as much attention as possible). The team, made up of 30 students and 6 teachers, meets twice a year to exchange ideas about projects all day long. Due to all of our projects, our school was recognized as an environmental school for the first time in autumn 2020 and for the second time in 2022.
